# Twinsspider_Ruby_Tasks
I have implemented two ruby programs.
#task1:
You make a function that examines an array of numbers ranging between 1 and 10 that’s missing one number and have the function find the number that’s missing.
For example, the series of numbers could be [2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 9, 7, 8, 10]. This array is missing the number 3. The goal of this problem is to write code that figures out that the number 3 is missing.

#task2
Calculate the sum of prime numbers: When calculating the sum of prime numbers, you first have to identify the prime numbers within an array. You then have to add all of these prime numbers together.
